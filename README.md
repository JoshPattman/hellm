# HeLLM: The Language You Never Knew You Didn't Need 🤯💀

Are you tired of your programming language being far too good? 😴 Do you find yourself frustrated by fast runtimes, reliable output, and helpful type systems? 😤 Introducing **HeLLM** 🎉 – the only language where *every single statement* is passed through a Large Language Model before it even thinks about running! 🤖✨ Why settle for deterministic, logical execution when you could have the full creative chaos of an LLM at your fingertips? 🎨🔥

## Features 🌟

- **LLM-Powered Everything** 🚀🤖  
  Every line, every variable, every print statement – all interpreted by a Large Language Model! 📝⚡ Who needs compilers when you have vibes? ✨🎭

- **Revolutionary Function System** 🔧⚙️  
  Define functions with `fn` and call them with `run`! 🏃‍♂️💨 Because why use normal function calls when you can confuse everyone with custom syntax? 😵‍💫 Functions even support multiple return values, although only as args as kwargs are far too readable! 📚❌

- **Pay-as-you-go Interpretation** 💸💳  
  HeLLM doesn't just interpret your code – it consults an LLM for every single step, ensuring maximum latency and minimum predictability! ⏰🎲

- **Nondeterministic Output** 🎰🎯  
  Since every statement is filtered through an LLM, you never know what you'll get! 🤷‍♂️ Your code might work, or it might write poetry. 📖✨ Isn't that exciting? 🎊

- **No Pesky Types** 🚫📊  
  Types are for the weak! 💪 In HeLLM, the LLM decides what your variables mean, and sometimes it changes its mind. 🧠💭 Function parameters? Just vibes. ✨🌈

- **Blazingly Slow** 🐌⚡  
  Why rush? 🤔 With every statement sent to an LLM, HeLLM ensures you have plenty of time to reflect on your life choices while waiting for your code to finish! ⏳😅

- **Expressive Syntax** 🎭📝  
  Write code that looks almost like English, but not quite enough to be understandable! 🤪 The LLM will figure it out. Or not. 🤖❓

- **All the Operators You Need!** ⚡🔧  
  HeLLM gives you the essentials: `if`, variable assignment, `while` loops, reading input from the CLI, printing to stdout, function definitions with `fn`, function calls with `run`, and even `return` statements! 🎯✅ All other operators are useless (trust me, ChatGPT says so, bro). 🤖💬


## Example 📝💡

```hellm

com "This is a comment, this is ommitted when interpreting";

com "Count to 5, printing each number";
let x = "0";
while "Is x < 5?" {
    let x = "Calculate x + 1";
    print x;
}

com "Query general knowledge";
let city = "The captial city of the UK";
print city;

com "Get the first command line arg";
use name = 0;

com "Define functions and run them from each other";

fn generate_greeting name {
    let greeting = "A greeting for the person called <name>";
    return greeting;
}


fn greet name {
    run msg = generate_greeting name;
    print msg;
}


com "Greet the name, then delete the name from the scope (so no more llm calls see it)";
run greet name;
del name;

com "Use conditional logic, with optional else blocks, and scoping";
let msg = "Empty string";
if "<city> is in europe" {
    let msg = "Exact text: Your city is in europe";
} else {
    let msg = "Exact text: Your city is not in europe";
}
print msg;
```

## Extra Features ⭐🎁
- **VSCode Extension Available** 💻🔌  
  Enjoy first-class HeLLM support in Visual Studio Code: 🎉
  - Syntax highlighting for all your HeLLM masterpieces. 🎨✨
  - Document formatting to keep your code looking sharp (but beware: extra whitespace is strictly forbidden — this isn't Python, after all). 📏🚫
  - Instant feedback as you type, so you can focus on creative chaos, not code style. ⚡🎭

## Installation 🛠️📦

Follow these steps to get HeLLM up and running: 🏃‍♂️💨

1. **Be on Unix** 🐧💻  
   Sorry, Windows users – HeLLM only installs using the makefile on Unix-like systems. 😢 You can probably install manually though. 🛠️

2. **Set Your OPENAI_KEY Environment Variable** 🔑🌍  
   HeLLM needs access to an OpenAI API key. 🤖 Set your `OPENAI_KEY` environment variable in your shell: 💻
   ```
   export OPENAI_KEY=sk-...
   ```
   (Replace `sk-...` with your actual OpenAI API key, so you can track how much money you are ~~wasting~~ enjoying.) 💸😄

3. **Install Go** 🐹⚡  
   You'll need Go (Golang) installed. 📦 If you don't know how, I'm sure ChatGPT can help. 🤖💭

4. **Install the HeLLM Tool** 🔧⚙️  
   Open your terminal and run: 💻
   ```
   make tool
   ```
   This will build the HeLLM tool and install it to `/usr/local/bin`. 📁✅

5. **Install the VSCode/Cursor Extension** 🧩💻  
   Still in your terminal, run: ⌨️
   ```
   make extension
   ```
   This will copy the extension to your VSCode and Cursor extensions folders. 📂🎯

That's it! 🎉 You're ready to write the most exciting and expensive code of your life! 💰🔥 If you need to see the subcommands of hellm, run `hellm help`. 📖❓
